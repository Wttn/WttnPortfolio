        "aboutText": "My background involves a degree in computer networks and working as an IT analyst, where I've been responsible for server management, database maintenance, and IT department leadership. I've gotten the opportunity to work with a variety of users in support, instruction, and training, during my time as a professional. These discussions gave me the chance to hear about their worries as well as ideas, which made me want to create programs that would solve their issues. That's how I met UX Design, immersing myself in activities such as user testing, research, interface enhancement, and feedback gathering. Because of my intimate contact with people, I always gave priority to creating solutions that addressed their demands. I made the decision that my objective would be to develop accessible and user-friendly solutions and designs after realizing that many readily available solutions were not used effectively owing to bad design choices, creating confusion and unease among users. I hope to have a positive impact on people's lives in this way. I was inspired to pursue a profession in UX design because of this."

After looking through my previously released portfolio, it gave the impression that I was looking for ways to get into the UX industry and present my knowledge. The projects in this initial portfolio, which I put together while earning the Google UX certification through Coursera, were ones I worked on throughout the course and as an IT analyst. Although it was a significant turning point, once I began working in the industry directly, I felt the need to create a fresh portfolio that better reflected my work and personality.",
        "introductionParagraph2": "One of the most significant changes I made was creating a page that presented the projects clearly and approached my work more directly. Although I had chosen a One Page website format for my previous portfolio, some comments mentioned that it was too lengthy. Taking advantage of this feedback, I decided to build a new portfolio with topics divided into separate pages to provide a better user experience.",

I challenged myself in this project and tried to create a portfolio from scratch, following the end-to-end process, making a prototype, writing the code, and deploying it to production. After completing the research and prototyping stages, I took some JavaScript courses and Chakra UI classes, and started turning my prototype into code.",

I chose not to delete it from my portfolio because, in specific cases, I send it to people who contact me with an interest in that aspect. Additionally, I consider illustration to be a part of my personality, so I decided to create a dedicated page for it, where I can showcase images with the desired quality, unlike social media platforms like Instagram, where the images tend to lose their quality and are primarily used for social purposes.",
