        "aboutText": "My background involves a degree in computer networks and working as an IT analyst, where I've been responsible for server management, database maintenance, and IT department leadership. I've gotten the opportunity to work with a variety of users in support, instruction, and training, during my time as a professional. These discussions gave me the chance to hear about their worries as well as ideas, which made me want to create programs that would solve their issues. That's how I met UX Design, immersing myself in activities such as user testing, research, interface enhancement, and feedback gathering. Because of my intimate contact with people, I always gave priority to creating solutions that addressed their demands. I made the decision that my objective would be to develop accessible and user-friendly solutions and designs after realizing that many readily available solutions were not used effectively owing to bad design choices, creating confusion and unease among users. I hope to have a positive impact on people's lives in this way. I was inspired to pursue a profession in UX design because of this."
