        "aboutText": "My background involves a degree in computer networks and working as an IT analyst, where I've been responsible for server management, database maintenance, and IT department leadership. I've gotten the opportunity to work with a variety of users in support, instruction, and training, during my time as a professional. These discussions gave me the chance to hear about their worries as well as ideas, which made me want to create programs that would solve their issues. That's how I met UX Design, immersing myself in activities such as user testing, research, interface enhancement, and feedback gathering. Because of my intimate contact with people, I always gave priority to creating solutions that addressed their demands. I made the decision that my objective would be to develop accessible and user-friendly solutions and designs after realizing that many readily available solutions were not used effectively owing to bad design choices, creating confusion and unease among users. I hope to have a positive impact on people's lives in this way. I was inspired to pursue a profession in UX design because of this."

        "introductionParagraph": "I decided to improve my portfolio and show it more engagingly after becoming a professional in the field of user experience design (UX). After looking through my previously released portfolio, it gave the impression that I was looking for ways to get into the UX industry and present my knowledge. The projects in this initial portfolio, which I put together while earning the Google UX certification through Coursera, were ones I worked on throughout the course and as an IT analyst. Although it was a significant turning point, once I began working in the industry directly, I felt the need to create a fresh portfolio that better reflected my work and personality.",
        "introductionParagraph2": "One of the most significant changes I made was creating a page that presented the projects clearly and approached my work more directly. Although I had chosen a One Page website format for my previous portfolio, some comments mentioned that it was too lengthy. Taking advantage of this feedback, I decided to build a new portfolio with topics divided into separate pages to provide a better user experience.",

In the past, when I worked as an analyst, I used Wordpress with modular themes or the Hugo Framework. I challenged myself in this project and tried to create a portfolio from scratch, following the end-to-end process, making a prototype, writing the code, and deploying it to production. After completing the research and prototyping stages, I took some JavaScript courses and Chakra UI classes, and started turning my prototype into code.",

        "illustrationsParagraph": "Another important point was the separation of pages related to my UX Design work and illustration, as the latter is an activity I engage in more as a hobby and freelancer. I chose not to delete it from my portfolio because, in specific cases, I send it to people who contact me with an interest in that aspect. Additionally, I consider illustration to be a part of my personality, so I decided to create a dedicated page for it, where I can showcase images with the desired quality, unlike social media platforms like Instagram, where the images tend to lose their quality and are primarily used for social purposes.",

In my previous portfolio, not all content was translated and, eventually, was set aside. I ensured that all content was translated in this stage of my development. Another challenge was learning to use the react-i18next library for internationalization (i18n), adapting the site to support two languages, which posed an additional challenge.",
